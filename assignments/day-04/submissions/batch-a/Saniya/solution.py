### Question 6: Count Word Frequency
#.Create a list of words:
#Use a dictionary to count how many times each word appears and print the dictionary.
words = ["python", "ai", "python", "data", "ai", "python"]

print(word_count)                                                        # Creating a list of words and counting the frequency of each word using

### Question 8: Common Elements
# Create two sets:
python_students = {"Aman", "Priya", "Raj", "Neha"}
ai_students = {"Raj", "Neha", "Vivek", "Shalu"}
#Find the common students and print them as a sorted list.
common_students = python_students.intersection(ai_students)
print("Common students in both sets (sorted):")
print(sorted(common_students))                                           # Creating two sets of students, finding common students and printing them as a sorted list
