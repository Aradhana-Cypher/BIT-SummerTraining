# Greedy generation always selects the most probable next token,
# making the output more repeatable than sampling, which introduces
# randomness by selecting from multiple possible tokens.


# Question 9: Reflection


# 1. Generated facts should always be verified because language
#    models can produce incorrect or outdated information.
#
# 2. Bias in the training data may influence responses and
#    produce unfair or unbalanced outputs.
#
# 3. Model downloads may be difficult on a slow connection
#    because model files can be hundreds of megabytes in size.
#
# 4. CPU generation is usually slower because CPUs have fewer
#    parallel processing cores than GPUs for deep learning tasks.
#
# 5. Private or sensitive information should never be entered
#    into an unapproved AI system because it may create privacy
#    or security risks.
